# --- Day 2: Corruption Checksum ---
#
# As you walk through the door, a glowing humanoid shape yells in your
# direction.  "You there!  Your state appears to be idle.  Come help
# us repair the corruption in this spreadsheet - if we take another
# millisecond, we'll have to display an hourglass cursor!"
#
# The spreadsheet consists of rows of apparently-random numbers.  To
# make sure the recovery process is on the right track, they need you
# to calculate the spreadsheet's checksum.  For each row, determine
# the difference between the largest value and the smallest value; the
# checksum is the sum of all of these differences.
#
# What is the checksum for the spreadsheet in your puzzle input?

puts IO.readlines("02.in")
  .map {|l| l.split.map{|x|x.to_i}.minmax.reduce(:-).abs }
  .reduce(:+)

# --- Part Two ---
#
# "Great work; looks like we're on the right track after all.  Here's
# a star for your effort."  However, the program seems a little
# worried.  Can programs be worried?
#
# "Based on what we're seeing, it looks like all the User wanted is
# some information about the evenly divisible values in the
# spreadsheet.  Unfortunately, none of us are equipped for that kind
# of calculation - most of us specialize in bitwise operations."
#
# It sounds like the goal is to find the only two numbers in each row
# where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of
# the division operation is a whole number.  They would like you to
# find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's
# result.
#
# What is the sum of each row's result in your puzzle input?

puts IO.readlines("02.in")
  .map {|l| l.split.map{|x|x.to_i}.sort.combination(2)
    .map {|x,y| if y%x == 0 then y/x else 0 end }
